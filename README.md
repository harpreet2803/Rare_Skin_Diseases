# Rare_Skin_Diseases

In this study, we present the first comprehensive implementation and evaluation of machine learning approaches for rare skin disease classification using MIMIC-IV EHR data, guided by the high-level roadmap proposed in Banerjee et al. (2023). Our contributions are as follows:

1. Dataset construction based on Orphanet + MIMIC-IV + FDA drug database integration. We combine structured EHR data from MIMIC-IV with classification data from Orphanet and drug-level information from the FDA drug database to construct a clinically validated rare skin disease cohort. 
2. Evaluation of negative class selection on model performance. We construct four separate datasets with varying negative class definitions (common diseases, rare non-skin diseases, common skin diseases, and a mixed group), allowing us to quantitatively demonstrate the impact of negative class selection on model performance, an issue largely overlooked in the rare disease ML literature.
3. Thorough Interpretability and Robust Error Analysis. We conduct in-depth post hoc model interpretability and error analysis using SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and anchor-based rule generation. We identify key feature drivers, highlight high-confidence misclassifications, analyze decision boundaries, and extract rules that explain up to 80\% of correctly classified rare skin disease cases
4. Fairness Evaluation for Demographically Sensitive Diseases. Recognizing the importance of racial and demographic variation in skin disease manifestation, we conduct a subgroup fairness analysis using DALEX and SHAP. We demonstrate that model performance variation across racial groups may reflect true clinical differences
